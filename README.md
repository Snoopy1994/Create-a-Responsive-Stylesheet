# Create-a-Responsive-Stylesheet
The goal of the final project is to create a responsive website that has three distinct views - mobile, tablet, and large screens. By changing the display and width of elements you will change the layout from one horizontal div, to two horizontal divs, to three horizontal divs.  By adding media queries you can have these changes trigger automatically at different viewport sizes. 

The mobile view is provided for you 
as a zip file
.

You will need to edit the style.css file to add two media queries.

Query #1 will trigger at 772px and act as your "Tablet View"

Change the page layout so that divs are 45% of viewport width and images are no more 30% of viewport height. 

 (You will need to change more than just the width to achieve the change to the divsâ€¦)

Query #2 will trigger at 998px  and act as your "Large Screen  View"

Change the page layout so that divs are 30% of viewport width .  

No other changes are needed.
